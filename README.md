Simple and extendable PHP Mongo document system

I've used this as a base for a few projects and thought I decided to separate this as a stand-alone 
component to ease my own project maintenance. It contains a Document class which should be used as a 
base for custom models and a simple User class that provides very basic authentication features and 
class based CRUD permission system.

TODO: Examples.
